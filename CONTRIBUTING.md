Add a changeset. Good practice to add one per package for cleaner changelogs.

```bash
npm run changeset
```

Follow the prompts in the CLI.

Press spacebar to select and enter to confirm.

Press enter without selecting anything to skip (eg. the major bumps).

Can continue editing the changelog summary later in the generated markdown file.

Commit after adding a changeset(s).
