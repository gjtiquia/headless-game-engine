# @headless-game-engine/physics-2d

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3de52bd: The physics-2d package contains components such as BoxCollider2D and Rigidbody2D, which are driven by the PhysicsSystem2D, making use of the new System in the core package.

  BoxCollider2D is an AABB collider, and collision resolution will only apply to rigidbodies for now.
